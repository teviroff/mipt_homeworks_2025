# hw2

This project was generated using fastapi_template.

## UV

This project uses uv. It's a modern dependency management
tool.

To run the project use this set of commands:

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run -m hw2
```

This will start the server on the configured host.

You can find swagger documentation at `/api/docs`.

You can read more about uv here: https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/

## Docker

You can start the project with docker using this command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

If you want to develop in docker with autoreload and exposed ports add `-f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml` to your docker command.
Like this:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f deploy/docker-compose.dev.yml --project-directory . up --build
```

This command exposes the web application on port 8000, mounts current directory and enables autoreload.

But you have to rebuild image every time you modify `uv.lock` or `pyproject.toml` with this command:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

## Project structure

```bash

├── conftest.py  # Fixtures for all tests.
├── __main__.py  # Startup script. Starts uvicorn.
├── services  # Package for different external services such as rabbit or redis etc.
├── settings.py  # Main configuration settings for project.
├── static  # Static content.
├── tests  # Tests for project.
└── web  # Package contains web server. Handlers, startup config.
    ├── api  # Package with all handlers.
    │   └── router.py  # Main router.
    ├── application.py  # FastAPI application configuration.
    └── lifespan.py  # Contains actions to perform on startup and shutdown.
```

## Configuration

This application can be configured with environment variables.

You can create `.env` file in the root directory and place all
environment variables here. 

All environment variables should start with "HW2_" prefix.

For example if you see in your "hw2/settings.py" a variable named like
`random_parameter`, you should provide the "HW2_RANDOM_PARAMETER" 
variable to configure the value. This behaviour can be changed by overriding `env_prefix` property
in `hw2.settings.Settings.Config`.

An example of .env file:
```bash
HW2_RELOAD="True"
HW2_PORT="8000"
HW2_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
```

You can read more about BaseSettings class here: https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/

## Pre-commit

To install pre-commit simply run inside the shell:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

pre-commit is very useful to check your code before publishing it.
It's configured using .pre-commit-config.yaml file.

By default it runs:
* mypy (validates types);
* ruff (spots possible bugs);

## Running tests

If you want to run it in docker, simply run:

```bash
docker-compose run --build --rm api pytest -vv .
docker-compose down
```

For running tests on your local machine.


2. Run the pytest.
```bash
pytest -vv .
```
